Run the Windsurf workflow /changelog-manager.
If not in Windsurf, follow `skills/changelog-manager/SKILL.md` to create or update CHANGELOG.md with entries that include AI model/CLI attribution, PRD context, and task references.

Usage:
- `/changelog-manager` - Interactive mode (prompts for details)
- Automatically tracks which AI (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex) made the change
- Links to PRD and task files when relevant
