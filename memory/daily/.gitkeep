# Daily Notes Directory

This directory contains daily conversation logs in the format:
- YYYY-MM-DD.md

Daily notes are automatically created and maintained.
They are session-specific and typically not transferred during replication.

To start a new daily note, the memory-manager will create:
```
## HH:MM - [Session Type]

**User:** [Request summary]
**Agent:** [Action taken]

[Details of interaction]
```
